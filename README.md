🌍 What is Äkta?

Äkta is a non-custodial crypto payment app that makes group payments, offline transfers, and gasless settlements simple for everyday users.

Instead of forcing users to deal with wallets, gas fees, and failed transactions, Äkta lets them sign payment intent — while the system handles the rest securely on-chain.

❌ The Problem

Traditional crypto payments suffer from poor UX:

😖 Splitting expenses is manual and confusing

⛽ Users must pay gas for every action

📡 Offline payments are impossible

🧠 Too technical for normal users

Crypto shouldn’t feel harder than UPI or scanning a QR.

✅ The Äkta Solution

Users approve payments.
A relayer submits them.
The blockchain enforces truth.

✨ Clean UX
✨ No custody
✨ No gas for users
✨ Still fully decentralized
